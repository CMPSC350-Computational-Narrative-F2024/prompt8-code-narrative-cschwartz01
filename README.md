# Prompt 8: Code as a Narrative

## DUE: November 11th by 12pm

> "Code as Narrative" refers to the idea that code, beyond performing functions, can tell a story through its structure, variable names, comments, and logical flow. Much like a narrative, code reveals intent, conveys meaning, and guides readers through a progression of ideas. By thinking of code as a narrative, we can approach programming as a form of storytellingâ€”where the characters are functions and variables, the plot is the program's logic, and the purpose is revealed through design choices.

## Summary

In our final prompting assignment, we  explore the concept of code as a form of narrative. You will use GitHub Copilot to co-create code that tells a story or conveys a concept through its structure, comments, and functionality. This process will involve designing prompts to guide Copilot, then evaluating its output as a narrative piece, and analyzing how the generated code reflects storytelling elements. This process encourages you to think about code not just as a set of instructions for machines, but as a medium for expression and communication.

## Goals

* Use prompt engineering with GitHub Copilot to generate code that serves as a narrative.
* Analyze the narrative aspects of the generated code, including structure, comments, and design choices.
* Reflect on how coding conventions can convey meaning and support narrative themes.

## Outcomes

* 1 generated code (using GitHub Copilot) which engage the idea of code as a narrative. Choose one of the following themes for your code narrative:
  * _Collaboration_: Code that reflects teamwork and collaboration, perhaps through functions that interact or share data.
  * _Discovery_: Code that represents a journey of exploration, showcasing how algorithms can uncover insights or patterns.
  * _Conflict_: Code that illustrates a challenge or problem-solving process, emphasizing conditional logic or error handling.
* 1 generated code along the same themes using same prompts that is generated using another LLM (`OpenAI`, `Claude` or one of the `ollama` models)
* __Submit__:
  * in `/writing` directory, all prompts used (must try at least three prompts, each modified based on previous output), prompting reflection and evaluation of the output;
  * in `src/` directory, two files for the final generated code (in any programming language), one by Copilot stored in `src/code_narrative1` and second by any single model stored in `src/code_narrative2`.
