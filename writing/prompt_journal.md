## 1. Prompts Used

try at least three variations and use the same final prompts for both Copilot and another LLM
- Generate code that has a theme of collaboration, which reflects teamwork and collaboration, perhaps through functions that interact or share data.
- Using this code, add in an option for user input so that the user can be a part of the collaboration
- Instead of the data being numbers, lets change it to personal information such as name, age, and college major/minor

## 2. Prompting Strategy

What was your strategy with prompting. What worked and what didn't work? Did you employ a specific prompting technique (zero-, few-, many-shot, chaining, chain of thought, meta prompting)?
My strategy was essentially a zero-shot prompt and also prompt chaining because I had the LLM edit the code that it previously came up with to better suit my needs.

## 3. Output Evaluation

For each generated code output, consider:
    - Narrative Structure: How does the organization reflect the theme? Is there a clear flow that resembles a narrative?
    - Commentary and Documentation: How do Copilotâ€™s comments contribute to the narrative? Do they add meaning to the code?
    - Design Choices: Evaluate how Copilot's naming conventions, variable usage, and logic choices enhance or detract from the narrative.

### Copilot

I'm not sure if I would say that this code resembles a narrative, but it does allow the user to input theirself into the data so I suppose that could tell a story of sorts, especially because I was focused on themes of teamwork and collaboration. Copilot's naming conventions and logic choices made the code easy to read and readily digestible.

### Other Single LLM

For the other LLM, I used ChatGPT. This response was a bit odd in the sense that there was most certainly a much easier way to write code that would do the same thing, but I suppose the complexity of the code (for lack of a better word) could potentially impact the narrative. For this response, I think that there was less of a theme of collaboration because the user is able to change data that already exists, which to me makes me think of someone in a group deciding that they have more of a say than another person.

## 4. Reflection

How did your prompt iterations impacted the narrative quality of the generated code? How did Copilot's suggestions supported or hindered the story within the code?

The iterations allowed me a base to go off of and change specific things to tailor the code to exactly what I wanted.
